# SkylandersVirtualPortal
Use your android device like a PortalMaster! with this app (and this edited version of cemu) you can summon skylanders, MagicItem, Expansions, Traps, Crystals, Etc... directly in cemu emulator skylanders games!

# Installation Tutorial
In the [release](https://github.com/TonyHacker03/SkylandersVirtualPortal/releases) section you can find 2 files and one folder
- Cemu.exe (this is the edited version of cemu)
- VirtPort.apk (this is the android app package)
- SkylandersDump.zip (in this archive there is the folder that contains skylanders files)

Install latest cemu [release](https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/releases) place it where you want, delete or rename Cemu.exe from the folder and paste the Cemu.exe you have downloaded here

Install the VirtPort APK in your android device (do not worry about viruses or similar warnings) 

Place the SkylandersDump folder (make sure that the folder has in it 6 subfolders one for each game) in a secure place (I recommend in cemu folder itself)

DONE!
